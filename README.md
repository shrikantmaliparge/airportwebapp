# Backend Developer Assessment
##Steps:
### Fork the repo
 - There are 3 CSV files in the repository. The files contain data for countries, airports and runway information.
### Write a program that will ask the user for two options - Query or Reports.
#### Query
 - Query Option will ask the user for the country name or code and print the airports & runways at each airport. The input can be country code or country name.
 - For bonus points make the test partial/fuzzy. e.g. entering zimb will result in Zimbabwe :)
#### Report
Choosing Reports will print the following:
 - 10 countries with highest number of airports (with count) and countries  with lowest number of airports.
 - Type of runways (as indicated in "surface" column) per country
 - Bonus: Print the top 10 most common runway latitude (indicated in "le_ident" column)
 - Feel free to use any library/framework in java as necessary.

**_Important: Please write the code as if you are writing production code, possibly with tests._**
